# Fortune Teller

This project is built in Tinkercad in C++. It recreates a Fortune Teller whereby a person asks a question and receives a {randomly generated} response out of six possible. To do so, firstly, I setup the servo motors library and pins. I attached servo to pin and wrote a for loop that keeps rotating until the motor stops, directing to one of responses. The LEDs create the feeling of suspense blinking while the motors rotate. Users press the button and after some time receive an answer.

The project can be further developed and include sounds and written message using Piezo and LCD.
